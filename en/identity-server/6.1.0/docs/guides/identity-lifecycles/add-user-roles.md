---

## Use SCIM 2.0 REST API

In SCIM 2.0, creating a role is the same as creating a **group**.

!!! note
    To create a group with users, the relevant users should already exist in the user store.
    

Use the following curl command to create a new user group with a new member. The attributes you have to include in the cURL command are the `userID`, `username:password`.

The sample request given below adds a group named "engineer" with the user "Mark" as a member.

**Request**

``` curl
curl -v -k --user {IS_USERNAME}:{IS_PASSWORD} --data '{"displayName": {GROUP_NAME},"members": {MEMBERS_OF_THE_GROUP}}'}}' --header "Content-Type:application/json" https://{IS_IP}:{IS_PORT}/wso2/scim2/Groups
```

!!! abstract ""
    **Sample Request**
    ```
    curl -v -k --user admin:admin --data '{"displayName": "engineer","members": [{"value":"008bba85-451d-414b-87de-c03b5a1f4217","Mark": "Mark"}]}' --header "Content-Type:application/json" https://localhost:9443/wso2/scim2/Groups
    ```

    **Sample Response**

        "id":"7bac6a86-1f21-4937-9fb1-5be4a93ef469",
        "schemas":["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Group"],
        "displayName":"PRIMARY/engineer",
        "members":[
            {"value":"008bba85-451d-414b-87de-c03b5a1f4217","display":"Mark"}
        ],
        "meta":{
            "lastModified":"2020-04-26T18:31:57",
            "created":"2020-04-26T18:31:57",
            "location":"https://localhost:9443/scim2/Groups/7bac6a86-1f21-4937-9fb1-5be4a93ef469"
        }
