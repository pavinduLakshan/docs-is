# Alert Types

By default, ELK is capable of triggering alerts for the following
situations.

### Suspicious Login

- **Reason for Triggering** : A successful login after a particular
  number of failed login attempts during a given time interval.
- **Indication** : A sudden change in the level of access granted to a
  specific user ID that indicates the need for further investigation.
- **Alerting Logic** : An alert is sent if a user successfully logs in
  after a specific number of failures. These failures can be due to
  repeatedly entering the following:
    - Same incorrect username

    - Same incorrect user store

    - Same incorrect tenant domain

### Long Sessions

- **Reason for Triggering** : The session duration of a specific user
  exceeds a predefined time duration.
- **Indication** : The user is engaged in unauthorized activity.
- **Alerting Logic** : An alert is sent if,
    - The duration of a session exceeds the predefined session
      duration

    - The duration of a session exceeds the average session duration
      calculated for a predefined time interval. This time interval is
      specified as the last n days, e.g., last 7 days.

There are two ways to be informed of above alerts:

- **Alert Dashboard**- Displays alerting events (long sessions and
  suspicious logins). This approach does not provide any notification and is more of a pull-based approach. Learn how to [configure the alert dashboard]({{base_path}}/deploy/elk-configuring-alerts).
- **Alert Rules with Connectors** - Can be used to receive
  notifications for the events that can be viewed from the Alert Dashboard. This is a push-based approach where
  the alert is sent to a given set of connectors such as email, Jira, Slack etc. Learn how to [configure alert connectors]({{base_path}}/deploy/elk-configuring-alerts).
