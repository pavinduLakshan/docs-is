1.  Log in to the WSO2 Identity Server Management Console (`https://<IS_HOST>:<PORT>/carbon`) using administrator credentials (`admin:admin`).

2.  Navigate to **Main** > **Identity** > **Users and Roles** > **Add**.

3.  Click **Add New User** and enter username and password.Â  When adding a new user, use an email address as the username. Since it is not mandatory
