WSO2 Identity Server comprises three different registry repositories.

1. **Local Repository**: Stores configuration and runtime data that is local to the server.

2. **Configuration Repository**: Stores product-specific configurations.

3. **Governance Repository**: This stores configuration and data that are shared across the whole platform. This typically includes services, service descriptions, endpoints, or data sources.
