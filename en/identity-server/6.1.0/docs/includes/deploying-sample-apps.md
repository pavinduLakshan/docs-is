### Prerequisites

- Download [Apache Tomcat 8.x](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi) and install it. Tomcat server installation location will later be referred to as `<TOMCAT_HOME>` in this guide.

- It is recommended that you use a hostname that is not `localhost` to avoid browser errors. Modify your machine's `/etc/hosts` entry to reflect this.

    !!! info
        Note that `wso2is.local` is used in this documentation as an example, but you must modify this when configuring the authenticators or connectors with this sample application.
