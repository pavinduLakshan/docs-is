# OpenID Connect Scopes and Claims

## Scopes

By using OpenID Connect scopes, it defines what access privileges should be granted to an access token. 
Usually [claims](#claims) are associated with scopes and based on the scopes, specific set of information will be returned
to the client as claim values.

The [OpenID Connect specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims) defines the 
following set of scopes. WSO2 Identity Server allows to define any other custom scope.

- openid
- profile
- email
- address
- phone

The `openid` scope is considered as a special scope and it is mandatory for OpenID Connect requests to have this scope.
The mandatory `sub` claim should be associated with this scope. The other scopes defined in the scopes are optional.

A sample way to request scopes is shown below.
```
scope=openid profile email phone
```

## Claims

Claims are name value pairs that contain information about the user attributes. These claims are associated with OpenID 
Connect [scopes](#scopes)  and the client applications can request claims about the end-user.


A sample scope-claim mapping based on the [specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims)
is shown below.
