# Set Up Separate Databases for Clustering

WSO2 Identity Server uses a database to store information such as
user management details and identity data. By
default, WSO2 Identity Server is shipped with an embedded H2 database that
works for all types of data.

This section guides you through the logical separation of data that you
can do when clustering WSO2 Identity Server. 

!!! warning "Embedded H2 is NOT RECOMMENDED in production"
    The embedded H2 database is not recommended for enterprise testing and 
    production environments. It has lower performance, clustering
    limitations, and can cause file corruption failures. Therefore, use an
    industry-standard RDBMS such as Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MS SQL
    instead.
    
    !!! tip "Before you begin"
        Creating separate databases as shown below is not mandatory. Instead, 
        you can point all the following datasources according to the default data structure. 
        This will not make a difference in performance. For more information on default 
        database structure, see [Working with Databases]({{base_path}}/deploy/work-with-databases).

The following image shows the default database structure and a recommended 
database structure for a logical separation of data.
