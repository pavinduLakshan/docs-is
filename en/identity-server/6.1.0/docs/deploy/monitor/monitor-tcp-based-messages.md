# Monitor TCP-Based Messages

Users can view and monitor the messages passed along a TCP-based
conversation using the TCPMon utility. Therefore, this is a convenient
tool, particularly useful for debugging when you develop web
services.Â TCPMon is an Apache project distributed under [Apache 2.0
License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

TCPMon is independent of third party libraries. Its user interface
is based on a swing UI and works on almost all the platforms that support
Java.
