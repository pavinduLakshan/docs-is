# Maintain Logins and Passwords

Changing default credentials before deploying the server in a production environment is crucial. Using default login information poses a significant security risk by making the system vulnerable to unauthorized access. This section provides guidance on enhancing the security of the {{product_name}} console by updating login details.

## Change the super admin password

To change the default admin password, log in to the {{product_name}} MyAccount portal with admin credentials and [change the password]({{base_path}}/guides/user-self-service/change-password/)

## Recover a password

If you forget your password, you can recover it using the [password recovery]({{base_path}}/guides/your-is/recover-password/) option available on the {{product_name}}.

## Log in with an email address

You can configure the {{product_name}} to authenticate users using an email address instead of a username. Refer to [Enable Using Email Address as the Username]({{base_path}}/guides/users/attributes/enable-email-as-username/) for further information.
