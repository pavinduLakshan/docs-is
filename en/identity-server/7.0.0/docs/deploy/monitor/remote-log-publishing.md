# Remote Log Publishing

The Remote Log Publishing feature in {{ product_name }} allows organizations to securely transmit and store [audit logs]({{base_path}}/deploy/monitor/monitor-logs/) on an external server. This capability ensures that critical log data is not only preserved in a secure location but also remains readily accessible for thorough analysis and compliance auditing.

## Setting Up Remote Audit Log Publishing

!!! note "Before you begin"

    - Ensure that the WSO2 Identity Server is up and running.
    - Have access to an external log storage solution that is reachable over the network.

Follow the steps below to configure remote log publishing to an external system:

1. On the {{ product_name }} Console, go to **Server**.
2. Click **Remote Log Publishing**.
3. Enter the following details of the remote log publisher and click **Update**:

!!! tip

    - After the configurations are set, generate test log events to ensure that the logs are being successfully published to the external system.

    - Secure the transmission of logs by utilizing HTTPS and other security mechanisms to protect the data in transit.

    - If any issues arise with remote log publishing, check the network connectivity, verify the configurations, and ensure the external log service is operational.
