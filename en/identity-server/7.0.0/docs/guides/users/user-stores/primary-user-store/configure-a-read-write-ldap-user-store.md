# Configure a Read-write LDAP user store

Refer [properties for a read-write LDAP user store]({{base_path}}/guides/users/user-stores/user-store-properties/properties-read-write-ldap-user-store/) to find the properties which are supported for read-write 
LDAP user stores. Below is a sample with minimum configurations and properties to change the primary user store 
to a Read-Write LDAP user store.

``` toml
[user_store]
type = "read_write_ldap_unique_id"
base_dn = "ou=system"
connection_url = "ldap://localhost:10389"
connection_name = "uid=admin,ou=system"
connection_password = "admin"
```

!!! note
    It is recommended to use the `createTimestamp` and `modifyTimestamp` operational attributes for 
    `created` and `modified` attributes. Therefore, add the following to the `deployment.toml` file.
    ``` toml
    [user_store]
    timestamp_attributes = "modifyTimestamp,createTimestamp"
    immutable_attributes = "modifyTimestamp,createTimestamp"
    ```

    !!! warning
        If there are more immutable attributes, you need to add them to the `immutable_attributes` property.

### Initial configuration for new servers

If you are configuring a server that has not been started yet, you need to update the claim mappings in
`<carbon_home>/repository/conf/claim-config.xml`.

!!! note
    Following are some of the mandatory claims that you need to map with the user store attributes.

      - `http://wso2.org/claims/username`
      - `http://wso2.org/claims/userid`
      - `http://wso2.org/claims/created`
      - `http://wso2.org/claims/modified`

    For `created` and `modified` claims, it is recommended to use the `createTimestamp` and `modifyTimestamp` 
    operational attributes.

    For `username` and `userid` claims, the `Username Attribute` and `User ID Attribute` properties configured in the User Store configuration should be used to ensure proper user authentication.

### Updating configuration for existing servers

!!! warning
    Changing the primary user store of a production server can have a significant impact on the users and the applications that are using the system. Therefore, it is recommended to have a scheduled maintenance window to perform this task.

Before you change `deployment.toml` with above configurations, you need to change the attributes mappings for the 
`PRIMARY` user store by navigating to the **User Attributes & Stores** > **Attributes** section of the console. After 
updating the mappings, shutdown the server, update the `deployment.toml` file and restart the server to apply the 
configurations.

!!! note
    Following are some of the mandatory claims that you need to map with the user store attributes.

      - `http://wso2.org/claims/username`
      - `http://wso2.org/claims/userid`
      - `http://wso2.org/claims/created`
      - `http://wso2.org/claims/modified`
    
    Refer to the [Update Attributes]({{base_path}}/guides/users/attributes/manage-attributes/#update-attributes) 
    to learn more on updating attribute mappings.  For `created` and `modified` claims, it is recommended to use the 
    `createTimestamp` and `modifyTimestamp` operational attributes.

    For `username` and `userid` claims, the `Username Attribute` and `User ID Attribute` properties configured in the User Store configuration should be used to ensure proper user authentication.

    !!! Warning
        If you have more than one tenant, you need to change the claim mappings for each tenant before adding the 
        new configurations to the `deployment.toml` file.
        
        If are planning to create new tenants in the future, you need to update the claim mappings in 
        `<carbon_home>/repository/conf/claim-config.xml`. 


## Configure tenant manager

Configure the tenant manager to user CommonHybridLDAPTenantManager.  Make sure to configure `RootPartition` property 
as it determines the root of the LDAP tree.

``` toml
[tenant_manager.ldap]
enabled=true
class="org.wso2.carbon.user.core.tenant.CommonHybridLDAPTenantManager"
[tenant_manager.ldap.properties]
RootPartition="dc=example,dc=org"
```

## Update the system administrator

The **admin** user is the super tenant that will be able to manage all
other users, roles, and permissions in the system. Therefore, the user that should have admin
permissions is required to be stored in the user store when you start
the system for the first time. Since the LDAP user store can be written
to, you have the option of creating a new admin user in the user store
when you start the system for the first time. Alternatively, you can
also use a user ID that already exists in the LDAP. For information
about the system administrator user, see [Configuring the System
Administrator]({{base_path}}/deploy/configure/user-stores/configure-system-administrator).

These two alternative configurations can be done as explained below.

-   If you are using a user that is already in the LDAP. Find a valid user that already resides in the user store. For 
    example, say a valid username is
    AdminSOA.Add the following configuration to the `deployment.toml` file as shown below. You do not have to update the password element as it is already set in the user store.
    
    ```toml
    [super_admin]
    username = "AdminSOA"
    admin_role = "admin"
    create_admin_account = false
    ```

-   if you are creating a new admin user in the user store when you start the system. you can add the super tenant
    user to the user store. Add the following configuration to the `deployment.toml` file as shown below.
    
    ```toml
    [super_admin]
    username = "AdminSOA"
    admin_role = "admin"
    create_admin_account = true
    password = admin
    ```
