# Add MFA based on user roles

You can enable a more secure login flow for users that belong to specific roles associated with the application by applying the **Role-Based** conditional authentication template for Adaptive MFA. This template enables two-factor authentication with TOTP or passkeys for users who belong to the user role you specify.

## Scenario

Consider a scenario with two roles, `admin` and `manager` associated with an application. For users assigned to these roles, the login flow in the application should be stepped up with TOTP or passkeys as follows:

1. Username and password
2. TOTP or Passkey

## Prerequisites

- You need to [register an application with {{ product_name }}]({{base_path}}/guides/applications/). You can register your own application or use one of the [sample applications]({{base_path}}/get-started/try-samples/) provided.

- Create two roles named `admin` and `manager` in application audience selecting the created application or create roles in organization audience and associate to the created application.

    - [Managing roles]({{base_path}}/guides/users/manage-roles/)
  
- Assign user accounts to the created roles. For instructions, see the following:

    - [Managing users]({{base_path}}/guides/users/manage-users/#onboard-a-user)
    - [Assigning users to roles]({{base_path}}/guides/users/manage-roles/#assign-users-to-a-role)

## Configure the login flow

To enable conditional authentication:

1. On the {{product_name}} Console, click **Applications**.

2. Select the relevant application and go to its **Login Flow** tab.

3. Add role-based adaptive MFA as follows:

    1. Go to **Predefined Flows** > **Conditional Login Flows**.

    2. Click **Adaptive MFA** > **Role-Based** > **Add** to add the role-based adaptive MFA script.

        ![Role-based adaptive MFA with visual editor]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/conditional-auth/role-based-adaptive-mfa-with-visual-editor.png){: style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

    3. Click **Confirm** to replace any existing script with the selected predefined script.

4. Verify that the login flow is now updated with the following two authentication steps:

    - Step 1: Username and Password
    - Step 2: TOTP and Passkey

5. Update the following parameter in the script.

      <table>
         <thead>
            <tr>
               <th>Parameter</th>
               <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
         </thead>
         <tbody>
            <tr>
               <td><code>rolesToStepUp</code></td>
               <td><p> Comma-separated list of user roles. Two-factor authentication should apply to users from these roles.</p> For this example scenario, enter <code>admin</code> and <code>manager</code>.</td>
            </tr>
         </tbody>
      </table>

6. Click **Update** to confirm.

## How it works

Shown below is the script of the role-based conditional authentication template.

```js
// This script will step up authentication for any user belonging
// to one of the given roles
// If the user has any of the below roles, authentication will be stepped up
var rolesToStepUp = ['admin', 'manager'];

var onLoginRequest = function(context) {
    executeStep(1, {
        onSuccess: function(context) {
            // Extracting authenticated subject from the first step
            var user = context.currentKnownSubject;
            // Checking if the user is assigned to one of the given roles
            var hasRole = hasAnyOfTheRolesV2(context, rolesToStepUp);
            if (hasRole) {
                Log.info(user.username + ' Has one of Roles: ' + rolesToStepUp.toString());
                executeStep(2);
            }
        }
    });
};
```

Let's look at how this script works.

1. When step 1 of the authentication flow is complete, the `onLoginRequest` function retrieves the user from the context.
2. The user and the configured list of roles are passed to the following function: `hasAnyOfTheRolesV2`.
3. This function (which is available in {{ product_name }} by default) verifies whether the given user belongs to any of the listed roles associated to the login application.
4. If the user belongs to any of the configured roles, authentication step 2 (TOTP or Passkey) is prompted.

!!! note
      Find out more about the scripting language in the [Conditional Authentication API Reference]({{base_path}}/references/conditional-auth/api-reference/).

## Try it out

Follow the steps given below.

1. Access the application URL.
2. Try to log in with a user who does not belong to any of the configured roles (`manager` or `admin`). You will successfully sign in to the application.
3. Log out of the application.
4. Log in with a user who belongs to the `admin` or `manager` role.

    The user will be prompted to select the step-up method, and the sign-in flow will be stepped up according to the user's preference.
