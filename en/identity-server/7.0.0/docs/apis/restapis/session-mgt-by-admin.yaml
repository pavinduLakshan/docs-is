  title: User Session Management API
  description: |
    This document specifies a **session management RESTFull API** for
    **WSO2 Identity Server**.
    The APIs provide the capability for privileged users to retrieve/delete sessions of the other users.
    
    <b>Note</b><br>
    - From WSO2 IS 6.0.0 onwards, access tokens mapped with the session via REST API can be revoked.
    This is applicable for authorization code grant, implicit flow, refresh token grant, and hybrid flow.
    - If a session is terminated via the API and the same access token is used by multiple sessions, the other sessions will lose their tokens. Therefore, it is recommended to use sso-session binding if you wish to retain the capability to revoke the access token when the session is terminated via the REST API.
    - WSO2 Identity Server also sends SAML/OIDC back-channel logouts when the session is terminated via the API. To support this, you should configure the application to enable back-channel logout.

        Condition to filter the retrieval of records.
        The filter parameter must contain at least one valid expression (for multiple expressions they must be combined using the 'and' logical operator).
        Each expression must contain an attribute name followed by an attribute operator and a value (attribute names, operators and values used in filters are case insensitive).

        The operators supported in the expression are listed next
        | Operator | Description | Behavior |
        |----------|-------------|----------|
        | eq | equal | The attribute and operator values must be identical for a match. |
        | sw | starts with | The entire operator value must be a substring of the attribute value, starting at the beginning of the attribute value. |
        | ew | ends with | The entire operator value must be a substring of the attribute value, matching at the end of the attribute value. |
        | co | contains | The entire operator value must be a substring of the attribute value for a match. |
        | le | less than or equal to | If the attribute value is less than or equal to the operator value, there is a match. |
        | ge | greater than or equal to | If the attribute value is greater than or equal to the operator value, there is a match. |

        The attributes supported in the expression are listed next
        | Name | Operators | Description |
        |------|-----------|-------------|
        | loginId | eq, sw, ew, co | Filter results by the login identifier of the user who owns the session. |
        | sessionId | eq, sw, ew, co | Filter results by the ID of the session. |
        | appName | eq, sw, ew, co | Filter results by the name of the application related to the session. |
        | ipAddress | eq | Filter results by the IP address of the session. |
        | userAgent | eq, sw, ew, co | Filter results by the user agent of the session. |
        | loginTime | le, ge | Filter results by the login time of the session. |
