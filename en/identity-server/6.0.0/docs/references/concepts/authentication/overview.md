# Overview


### Introduction to tokens
Tokens are associated with the authorization which is used to gain access to a restricted resource. Usually, the tokens
which have a defined lifespan will carry information or act like credentials in the authorization flow.

In the OAuth 2.0 flow there two types of tokens that are engaged in the authorization process.

[Access Token]({{base_path}}/authorization/access-token.md)
 
[Refresh Token]({{base_path}}/authorization/refresh-token.md)

Apart from the two token types given above, the OpenID Connect flow also involves the [ID Token]
[ID Token](id-token.md).
