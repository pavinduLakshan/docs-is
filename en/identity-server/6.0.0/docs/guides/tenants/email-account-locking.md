!!! tip
    The email template used to send the email notification for
    account locking is the **AccountLock** template and the template
    used for account disabling is the **AccountDisable** template. You
    can edit and customize the email template. For more information on
    how to do this, see [Customize Automated
    Emails]({{base_path}}/guides/tenants/customize-automated-mails).

WSO2 Identity Server uses separate email templates for notifying, 

- Account locking by administrator
- Account unlocking by administrator 

There are default email templates available for the above-mentioned emails. However, you can choose to modify them if necessary as well. 

## View email templates in the management console

1.  Navigate to **Main** > **Manage** > **Email Templates** > **List**. 

2.  From the **Select Email Template Type** dropdown, select either  `AccountLockAdmin` or `AccountUnlockAdmin` to notify the locked and unlocked user respectively.

3.  You can customize the subject, body, and footer based on your requirement. 

4.  Click **Save**.
