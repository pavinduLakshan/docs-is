# Configuring multi-factor authentication for the management console

 This guide walks you through configuring multi-factor authentication for the Identity Server's Management Console.

 MFA configuration for the management console contains two configuration sections as follows:

1. [Configure the service provider](#configure-the-service-provider)
    - [Claim configurations](#claim-configurations)
    - [Inbound authentication configurations](#inbound-authentications-configurations)
    - [Local and outbound authentication configurations](#local-and-outbound-authentication-configurations)
2. [Configure the server](#configure-wso2-is)

## Prerequisites

You need to [create a service provider]({{base_path}}/guides/applications/register-sp).

## Configure the service provider

To configure MFA for the management console, initially:

1. On the management console, go to **Main** > **Identity** > **Service Providers** > **List**.

2. Click **Edit** on the service provider you wish to configure.

2. Enter the following details under **Manual Configuration**:

    | Field name    | Value |
    |---------------|-------|
    | Issuer    | carbonServer  |
    | Assertion Consumer URLs   | https://localhost:9443/acs    |
    | Enable Response Signing   | Selected  |

3. Click **Register** to save the configurations.

### Local and outbound Authentication configurations

To configure local and outbound authentication for the management console:

3. For both authentication steps, select the authenticator from **Local Authenticators** and click **+ Add Authenticator** to add the authenticator.

    !!! info
        - **Use subject identifier from this step** and **Use attributes from this step** will be selected by default. If you wish to set multiple steps, you can have only one step as the subject step and one as the attribute step.
        - Note that you cannot use `JWT Basic` option as an authentication step.

4. Click **Update** to save the configurations.

5. Enable the following options:
    - Use tenant domain in local subject identifier
    - Use user store domain in local subject identifier

    !!! info
        Leave the default configurations as it is.

6. Click **Update** to save the configurations.

## Configure WSO2 IS

To configure the local configuration on the IS:

1. Shut down the Identity server, and open the `deployment.toml` file in the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/` directory.

2. Add the following configuration to the `deployment.toml` file:

    ``` toml
    [admin_console.authenticator.saml_sso_authenticator]
    enable=true
    priority="1"
    assertion_consumer_service_url = "https://localhost:9443/acs"
    identity_provider_sso_service_url = "https://localhost:9443/samlsso"
    ```

3. Save the configurations.

## Try it out

1. Start the Identity Server.

2. Access the following URL: `https://localhost:9443/`

3. Enter your user credentials for the first authentication step.

4. On successful authentication, you will be prompted for the second authentication step. Enter the TOTP code and click **Continue**.

    ![TOTP verification]({{base_path}}/assets/img/samples/totp-code-verification.png)

    !!! info
        If this is the first time you use the TOTP authentication method for the application, you need to scan the QR from an authenticator application of your choice.

You will now be successfully logged into the management console.
