# Configure an multi-factor authentication

This section guides you on how to enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) in WSO2 Identity Server. By default, WSO2 Identity Server is shipped with username-and-password-based authentication. You can further strengthen the security of this authentication by adding additional authentication steps to authenticate with basic authentication, Security Key/Biometrics (FIDO), TOTP, etc.
