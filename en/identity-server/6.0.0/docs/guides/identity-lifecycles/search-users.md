# Search for Users

Once you have added a user in the Identity Server, you can search for
the user by doing the following.

## Use the management console

1.  On the **Main** > **Identity** tab in the Management Console, click **List** under
    **Users and Roles**.  
2.  Click **Users**. This link is only visible to users with the Admin
    role. The following screen appears.  
    ![search-users-in-console]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/search-users-in-console.png) 
    
    You can search for users by doing one of the following. 

    -   **Search by Domain**  
        1.	Select the user store that the user store in using the
            **Select Domain** dropdown.
        2.  Enter the user name of the user and click **Search Users**.
            For users to be listed, you must use the exact name of the
            user, or use a username pattern by including \*. For
            example, if you have a user named Don, you can either search
            for this user by searching for "Don", or you could search
            for "D\*" to list out all the users with names beginning
            with D.
        3.  The user is displayed in the list.  

    -   **Search by Claim**
        1.  Select the relevant claim URI from the **Select Claim Uri**
            dropdown and enter the claim value in the user name field.
        2.  Click on **Search Users**.


## Use the SCIM 2.0 REST API

You can search for users using a SCIM 2.0 REST API request as shown below. 

**Request**
