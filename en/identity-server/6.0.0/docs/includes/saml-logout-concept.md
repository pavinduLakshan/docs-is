SAML logout enables a user to log out of an application and simulatenously log out of other connected applications without having to explicitly log out of them one by one. The SAML 2.0 protocol has two approaches for single logout. 

1. Synchronous binding (back-channel)
2. Asynchronous binding (front-channel)

The main difference between back-channel logout and front-channel logout is that the front-channel method uses web browser redirections and user sessions to handle the logout, but the back-channel method is handled via server-to-server communication, and the need for browser redirections is eliminated. When using the back-channel protocol, you can rely on mutually authenticated TLS (Transport Layer Security) for end-to-end security since the communication is point-to-point.
