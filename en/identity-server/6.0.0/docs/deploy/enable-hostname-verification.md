# Enable HostName Verification

The possibility to configure hostname verification is available for WSO2
Identity Server. If hostname verification is disabled, the hostnames (that are accessed by a particular
client) will not be verified against the hostnames specified in the
product's SSL certificate. If hostname verification is enabled, you will
be able to configure how hostnames are filtered during the verification
process.

!!! note "Important"  
    Be sure to enable hostname verification for your production environment.
    This is necessary to avoid security issues in production. See the full
    list of [security recommendations for
    production]({{base_path}}/deploy/security/security-guidelines-for-production-deployment)
    environments.

## Configure hostname verification


In WSO2 Identity Server, hostname verification is enabled by default. This is
done using the `         httpclient.hostnameVerifier        ` property in the startup
script ( `         wso2server.sh        ` for Linux and
`         wso2server.bat        ` for Windows) as shown below. The
product startup script is stored in the
`         <IS_HOME>/bin        ` directory. This property will be
effective during server startup.

``` java
-Dhttpclient.hostnameVerifier="DefaultAndLocalhost"
```

The values you can use with this property are explained below. Note that
these values will behave the same as synapse hostname verification
options.

-   **DefaultAndLocalhost:** This is the value that is enabled, by
    default. This means that all hostnames, except the ones listed
    below, will be verified against the hostnames specified in the
    product's SSL certificate. That is, the following hostnames will be
    allowed regardless of the server's certificate.

    -   localhost

    -   localhost.localdomain

    -   127.0.0.1

    -   ::1

    If the wildcard symbol is used to specify a hostname in
    the SSL certificate (such as `*.foo.com`), all
    the subdomains of `*.foo.com` are also included.
    That is, a hostname that matches a subdomain of `*.foo.com` will also be allowed access. 

-   **Strict:** When this mode is enabled, hostnames will be strictly
    verified against the hostname specified in the product's SSL
    certificate. For example, if `*.foo.com` is
    specified as the hostname in the certificate, only the hostnames at
    the same level will be authorized by the server. That is, subdomains
    such as `a.b.foo.com` will not be authorized.

-   **AllowAll:** This option turns off hostname verification for the
    server. Note that this is not recommended in a production setup and
    should only be used for demonstrations and testing.

    !!! note "Important"    
        To disable hostname verification for WSO2 IS, use the
        following system properties.

        ``` java
        -Dorg.opensaml.httpclient.https.disableHostnameVerification=true \
        -Dhttpclient.hostnameVerifier="AllowAll" \
        ```
