# Username Recovery Via User Preferred Notification Channel

WSO2 Identity Server enables recovering user accounts where the user has forgotten the user name.

!!! Note
    This feature is only available via Account Recovery REST APIs. Currently, WSO2 IS does not 
    support this feature via the User Portal.    

**Username Recovery Flow**

 - The user provides a set of unique claims to identify the user account.
 - Next, the API prompts the user to select a channel from the available notification channels for receiving the 
 username recovery notification.
 - The user selects a notification channel.
 - The sever send the recovery notification to the user via the preferred notification channel.

The following sections walk you through configuring and trying out username recovery via SMS and Email 
Channels.   

??? Warning "If you have migrated from a previous IS version"
    If you have migrated from a previous IS version, ensure that the `IdentityMgtEventListener` with the
    `         orderId=50        ` is set to **false** and that the Identity
    Listeners with `         orderId=95        ` and
    `         orderId=97        ` are set to **true** in the
    `         <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml        ` file.
   
    !!! Note 
        You can skip this step if there are no entries for `event.default_listener.xxx`, in 
        the `deployment.toml` file.
    
    
    ``` java
    [event.default_listener.identity_mgt]
    priority= "50"
    enable = false
    [event.default_listener.governance_identity_mgt]
    priority= "95"
    enable = true
    [event.default_listener.governance_identity_store]
    priority= "97"
    enable = true
    ```
    
## Configuring username recovery

Follow the steps given below to recover a user in the super tenant (i.e., carbon.super).

1.  Add the following properties to the `deployment.toml` file in the `IS_HOME/repository/conf` folder to 
configure the configure WSO2 Identity Server to send confirmation emails.
    
    !!! Note
        You need to add this configuration only if you wish to configure WSO2 IS to send confirmation 
        emails. Alternatively, you can use your own email managing mechanism.

    ``` toml
    [output_adapter.email]
    from_address= "wso2iamtest@gmail.com"
    username= "wso2iamtest"
    password= "Wso2@iam70"
    hostname= "smtp.gmail.com"
    port= 587
    enable_start_tls= true
    enable_authentication= true
    ```    
    
2. Add the following properties to the `deployment.toml`. The `recovery_code_validity` property will 
determine the validity period of the recovery code given after initiating username/password recovery.

    ```toml
    [identity_mgt.notification_channel_recovery]
    recovery_code_validity=2
    ```
    
    !!! Note
        - Default value of the field is `1` minute.
        - If you have configured Password Recovery Via User Preferred Notification Channel, the above 
          field might be already configured.
          
3.  Add an event publisher to `<IS_HOME/repository/deployment/server/eventpublishers`. For this 
sample, `http output adapter` is used. Following is a sample publisher to call a REST Service 
to send confirmation codes.

    ??? info "Sample Event Publisher"
        ```
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <eventPublisher name="HTTPOutputEventAdapter" processing="enable"
            statistics="disable" trace="disable" xmlns="http://wso2.org/carbon/eventpublisher">
            <from streamName="id_gov_sms_notify_stream" version="1.0.0"/>
            <mapping customMapping="enable" type="json">
                <inline>{"api_key":"4c9374",
                    "api_secret":"FtqggE93",
                    "from":"NEXMO",
                    "to":{{mobile}},
                    "text":{{body}}
                    }</inline>
            </mapping>
            <to eventAdapterType="http">
                <property name="http.client.method">httpPost</property>
                <property name="http.url">https://rest.nexmo.com/sms/json</property>
            </to>
        </eventPublisher>
        ``` 
        
        !!! note
            This publisher uses NEXMO as the SMS REST service provider. For more information 
            on writing a custom http event publisher, see [HTTP Event Publisher](https://docs.wso2.com
            /display/DAS300/HTTP+Event+Publisher).  
            
4.  [Start WSO2 IS](../../setup/running-the-product#starting-the-server)
    and [log in to the management console](../../setup/running-the-product#accessing-the-management-console)
    : ` https://<IS_HOST>:<IS_PORT>/carbon `.  
    **NOTE:** If your IS is already running, make sure to restart to apply above configurations. 
    
5.  Navigate to **Main -> Identity Providers -> Resident -> Account Management Policies** section.

6.  Expand the **Account Recovery** section and configure the following properties.
