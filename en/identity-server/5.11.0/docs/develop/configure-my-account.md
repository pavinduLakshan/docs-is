## Enable and disable application features

**My Account** has several [features](#the-features) and those features, in turn, have several sub features. These features can be configured by applying configurations in the following format.

``` toml
<feature>.enabled = true
<feature>.disabled_features = []
<feature>.scopes.create = []
<feature>.scopes.read = []
<feature>.scopes.update = []
<feature>.scopes.delete = []
```

-	The `<feature>.disabled_features` parameter is used to disable sub features belonging to a feature.
-	The `<feature>.enabled` parameter can be used to toggle the feature as a whole. For instance, by setting the `<feature>.enabled` parameter of the `overview` feature, you can disable the `overview` feature as a whole.
-	The `<feature>.scopes` parameter is used to specify the scopes that a user should be allowed in order to access the concerned feature. The `<feature>.scopes` parameter has the following sub-attributes and each sub-attribute takes an array of scopes.

	```toml
	<feature>.scopes.create = []
	<feature>.scopes.read = []
	<feature>.scopes.update = []
	<feature>.scopes.delete = []
	```

	If you want a user to have a certain scope(s) to be able to create an application, then you can specify that/those scope(s) within the `application.scopes.create` array of the application feature.
