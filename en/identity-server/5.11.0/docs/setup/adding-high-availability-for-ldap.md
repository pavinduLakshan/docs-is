# Adding High Availability for LDAP

!!! warning
    This guide helps you to configure client-side load balancing. While we don't recommend client-side load balancing, we strongly recommend setting up high availability on the LDAP server side through server-side load balancing.

When connecting the WSO2 Identity Server to an external LDAP user store,
it may be necessary to have high availability for the LDAP as it
includes user information that must be available at all times. To attain
high availability for your LDAP, you would replicate the LDAP server to
effectively handle failover.

This topic provides instructions on how to configure the WSO2 Identity
Server when you add high availability to your LDAP.

1.  Open the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml`
    file and find the user store manager config relevant for your LDAP.  
    ```
    [user_store]
    type = "read_write_ldap_unique_id"
    ...
    ```
    
2.  Failover for LDAP is configured by defining LDAP connection URLs.
    Add `connection_url` to the `deployment.toml`. Refer to the following example.
    
    ```
    [user_store]
    type = "read_write_ldap_unique_id"
    connection_url = "ldap://localhost:10500 ldap://localhost:10511"
    ...
    ```
    
    !!! note
        This can be done for either a primary or secondary LDAP user store
        with failover configuration. In this example, if you cannot connect
        to ldap://localhost:10500, you can automatically connect to
        ldap://localhost:10511.
