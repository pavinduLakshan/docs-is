2. Click **Forgot username?**.

3. Enter the information for the account youâ€™re trying to recover, then click **Next**.

    ![Username recovery claim]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/organization/self-service/customer/username-recovery-claim.png){: width="300" style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}
