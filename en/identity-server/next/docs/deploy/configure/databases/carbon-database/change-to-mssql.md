# Change to MS SQL

By default, WSO2 Identity Server uses the embedded H2 database as the database
for storing user management and registry data. Given below are the steps
you need to follow in order to use MS SQL for this purpose.

---    

## Set up datasource configurations

{% include "../../../../includes/datasource-config.md" %}
                       
After setting up the MS SQL database, you can point the `WSO2_IDENTITY_DB` or 
`WSO2_SHARED_DB` or both to that MS SQL database by following the instructions given below.

## Change the default datasource

### Minimum configurations for changing default datasource to MS SQL
 
You can configure the datasource by editing the default configurations in `<IS-HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml`. 

Following are the basic configurations and their descriptions. 

{% include "../../../../includes/db-basic-config.md" %}
 
A sample configuration is given below.

1. `WSO2_IDENTITY_DB` 

    1. Configure the `<IS-HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file.

        ``` toml
        [database.identity_db]
        type = "mssql"
        hostname = "localhost"
        name = "regdb"
        username = "regadmin"
        password = "regadmin"
        port = "1433"
        ```
    
    2. Execute database scripts.
    
        Navigate to `<IS-HOME>/dbscripts`. Execute the scripts in the following files against the database created.
        
        - `<IS-HOME>/dbscripts/identity/mssql.sql`
        - `<IS-HOME>/dbscripts/consent/mssql.sql`
        
2. `WSO2_SHARED_DB`
    
    1.  Configure the `<IS-HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file.

        ``` toml
        [database.shared_db]
        type = "mssql"
        hostname = "localhost"
        name = "regdb"
        username = "regadmin"
        password = "regadmin"
        port = "1433"
        ```
        
    2.  Execute database scripts.
    
        Execute the scripts in the `<IS-HOME>/dbscripts/mssql.sql` file, against the database created.

    !!! note
        As Microsoft SQL Server is inherently case-insensitive, it is recommended to deactivate the case-insensitive functionality of {{product_name}} when integrating with the Microsoft SQL Server.
        Disabling this feature in {{product_name}} eliminates unnecessary processing, thereby potentially enhancing overall system performance.

        To disable case-insensitivity for the primary user store, open the `deployment.toml` file found in the `<IS-HOME>/repository/conf/` directory and add the following configurations to the primary user store.

        ``` toml
        [user_store.properties]
        CaseInsensitiveUsername = false
        UseCaseSensitiveUsernameForCacheKeys = false
        ```  
    
        For secondary user stores, add the following configurations to the `<userstore>.xml` file found in the `<IS_HOME>/repository/deployment/server/userstores` directory.

        ``` xml
        <Property name="CaseInsensitiveUsername">false</Property>
        <Property name="UseCaseSensitiveUsernameForCacheKeys">false</Property>
        ```
    
3.  Download the MS SQL JDBC driver for the version you are using and copy it to the `<IS_HOME>/repository/components/lib` folder.
