# About this Release

{{product_name}} 7.1.0 is the latest release, succeeding WSO2 Identity Server 7.0.0, with enhanced features, improvements, and fixes.

## What's new in this release?

WSO2 Identity Server 7.1.0 introduces a range of new features and enhancements:

- **Push Notification-Based Authentication**

    WSO2 Identity Server now supports Push Notification-Based Authentication, enabling a faster and more secure login experience. Instead of manually entering passwords or one-time codes, users can authenticate by approving a push notification on their mobile device.

    This feature enhances security by reducing reliance on passwords and SMS-based OTPs, which are vulnerable to phishing and interception. Organizations can seamlessly integrate push authentication into existing authentication flows, improving user experience while strengthening protection against unauthorized access.

- **AI-powered development**

    WSO2 Identity Server 7.1.0 introduces **AI LoginFlow** and **AI Branding**, bringing automation and intelligence to identity and access management. Previously, administrators had to manually configure authentication sequences and customize login pages, a process that was often time-consuming and prone to errors. With AI LoginFlow and AI Branding, WSO2 Identity Server 7.1.0 leverages AI-driven natural language inputs to simplify these tasks, reducing manual effort while minimizing configuration errors. These features enhance both user and administrator experiences by streamlining authentication setup and branding customization.

    - **AI LoginFlow** - Lets administrators define authentication flows using natural language, simplifying complex configurations and reducing setup effort. Learn more about [AI LoginFlow]({{base_path}}/guides/authentication/login-flow-ai/).

    - **AI Branding** - Allows administrators to customize login pages using natural language, making it easy to create designs that match their organization's identity. Learn more about [AI Branding]({{base_path}}/guides/branding/branding-ai/).

- **Custom Authentication Service Extension**
    
    Administrators can now extend authentication capabilities by implementing custom authentication services. This enhancement offers greater flexibility in addressing diverse authentication requirements beyond the built-in authenticators.

- **Pre-Issue Access Token Service Extension** 
    
    Supports executing custom logic before issuing an access token, providing greater flexibility in the OAuth2 token issuance process. This enhancement allows administrators to,
    
    - Add, modify, or remove scopes.
    - Add, modify, or remove audience values. 
    - Modify or remove user attributes incorporated into the access token.
    - Add custom claims (only string, number, boolean, and string type arrays are allowed).
    - Update the validity period of the access token.

    By integrating this functionality, organizations can enforce additional security checks or customize token contents to align with specific requirements.

- **Pre-update password service extension**

    Enables password validation during various password update flows. This can be achieved by integrating with credential intelligence services (such as `Have I Been Pwned` or `SpyCloud`) to check for compromised passwords or by enforcing allowed/disallowed password policies. This action is triggered in the following password update flows:

    - Self-Service Password Reset – The user initiates a password reset via the "Forgot Password" option and completes the recovery process.
    - Profile Update – The user updates their password through a self-service portal, such as the My Account application.
    - Admin-Initiated Password Reset – An administrator forces a password reset, requiring the user to set a new password.
    - Admin-Initiated User Invitation – An administrator invites a new user by resetting the password. The user then sets a new password as part of the registration flow.
    - Direct Admin Update – An administrator directly updates a user's password.

- **User Impersonation**

    User impersonation allows authorized personnel, such as support staff, to temporarily access another user's account without requiring their login credentials. This capability is crucial for troubleshooting, testing, and resolving user-reported issues efficiently.

    Business users can report issues through various channels, such as support tickets or direct communication with the support desk. Support personnel can then impersonate the affected user to investigate the reported issue, understand the actual flow, and gather additional information for further troubleshooting.

    Administrators can enable user impersonation within the same organization to streamline issue resolution and enhance support processes.
