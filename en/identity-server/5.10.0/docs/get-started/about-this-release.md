    <li><b><a href="../../learn/user-portal">An improved User Portal</a></b></li>

    <li><b>Introduce a unique user identifier across the system
</b><br>
Previously, the username of the user was considered as an immutable attribute across the system which had multiple limitations. Therefore a new unique user identifier has been introduced along with a new set of user core APIs.
Also new user store managers have been introduced for all the types such as JDBC, Read-Only LDAP, Read-Write LDAP, and Active directory which can be compatible with the new unique user identifier implementation. 
</li>
</ul>
