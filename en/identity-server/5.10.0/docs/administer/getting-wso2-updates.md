# Getting WSO2 Updates

**WSO2 Updates** include improvements (e.g., updates, hotfixes) that are released 
by WSO2 on top of a released WSO2 product version. With WSO2 updates, 
you do not have to wait until the next product version is released to get the fixes you want. 
Find out more about WSO2 updates at <https://wso2.com/updates>.

Check for new updates in your deployment environment by accessing the 
[WSO2 Updates Portal](https://updates-info.wso2.com/) using your WSO2 user credentials.
