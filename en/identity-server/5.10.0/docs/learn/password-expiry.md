## Password Expiry

WSO2 Identity Server supports configuring a password expiry policy to prompt users to change their password after a defined time period. This is supported via a connector. For more information and instructions on how to set this up, see [Connector Documentation: Configuring Password Policy](https://github.com/wso2-extensions/identity-outbound-auth-passwordPolicy/blob/master/docs/config.md).
