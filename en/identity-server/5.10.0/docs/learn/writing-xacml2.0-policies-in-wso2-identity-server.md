This section explains how to write custom XACML policies in WSO2
Identity Server.

!!! note "Before you begin"
    
    If you are a beginner, follow the documentation given below to gain a better 
    understanding of XACML architecture, XACML language, and syntax before you start writing XACML policies.

!!! info
    You can easily write a XACML policy using the policy editors
    available in WSO2 Identity Server. To try these sample policies using
    the editors, see [Creating a XACML Policy](../../learn/creating-a-xacml-policy).
