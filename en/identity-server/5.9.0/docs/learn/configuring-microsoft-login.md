# Configure Microsoft login as a federated authenticator

Microsoft login can be used as a federated authenticator in the
Identity Server.

Follow the steps given below to configure WSO2 Identity Server to
authenticate users with their Microsoft accounts.

## Register WSO2 Identity Server on Microsoft

You need to register WSO2 Identity Server as an OAuth2.0 application on Microsoft Entra ID.

!!! note
    For detailed instructions, you can follow the [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app){:target="_blank"}.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/){:target="_blank"} using an account with administrator permission.

    !!! note
        You must use an account in the same Microsoft 365 subscription (tenant) with which you intend to register the app.

2. Go to **Identity** > **Applications** > **App registrations** and select **New registration**.

3. Click **Add** and select **App registration** from the list.

4. Provide the required information for app registration.

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Parameter</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Name</td>
            <td>Enter a meaningful name for your application.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Supported Account Type</td>
            <td>Select the supported account type. <br><b>Value: </b><code>Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra ID tenant - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g., Skype, Xbox)</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Redirect URI</td>
            <td>Select <b>Web</b> as the platform and provide the URL to redirect after the login is completed.<br><b>Value:</b> <code>{{product_url_format}}/commonauth</code></td>
        </tr>
    </table>

5. Click **Register** to create the application.

    !!! note
        Take note of the client ID after the application is created.

Now, let's generate a client secret for the application.

1. Go to **Certificates & secrets** on the left navigation and click **+ New client secret**.
2. Enter a description for the client secret and select the expiry time.
3. Click **Add** to add the client secret.

    !!! note "Important"
        Take note of the generated **Value**. Microsoft Entra will allow copying this value only once. This value is the newly generated client secret for your Microsoft connection in WSO2 Identity Server.
