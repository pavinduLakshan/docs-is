# Sample JavaScript SPA

By following this guide, you will be able to deploy a Javascript single-page application locally and secure it with OpenID Connect.

## Prerequisites

- **npm with Node.js**

    If you don't have it, [install npm and node](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm){target="_blank"} in your local environment.

- **A user account in Asgardeo**

    If you don't already have one, [create a user account]({{base_path}}/guides/users/manage-users/#onboard-a-user) in Asgardeo.

## Register the app

Follow the steps given below to register the sample Javascript SPA in Asgardeo.

1. On the [Asgardeo Console](https://console.asgardeo.io/login), go to **Applications**.

2. Click **New Application** and select **Single-Page Application**.

3. Enter the following details:

    ![Create a new SPA]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/applications/create-new-spa.png){: width="700" style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Name</td>
            <td>Give a unique name to identify your application.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Authorized redirect URLs</td>
            <td>
                <p>The URL to which the user is redirected after a successful login. Use the following URL for this sample app:</p>
                <code>https://localhost:3000</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Allow sharing with organizations</td>
            <td>Enable this to share the new application with all or any selected B2B organizations that belong to your primary organization.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

4. Click **Register** to complete the registration.
5. Go to the **Protocol** tab and take note of the **Client ID**. You will need it to configure the application later.

    ![Client ID]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/applications/spa-client-id.png){: style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

!!! tip
    To provide a better experience for the user, it is recommended to configure an access URL for the application. You can set an access URL from the **General** tab of the application. (For this sample application, the access URL is <code>https://localhost:3000</code>).

    The access URL is used,

    - in the application catalog and discovery flows.
    - to redirect the user back to the application in the following scenarios.
        - if the login page times out
        - after a password reset
        - after the self sign-up verification
    - to re-initiate the login flow if the login flow fails.
