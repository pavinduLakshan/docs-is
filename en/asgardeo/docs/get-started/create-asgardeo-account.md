# Create your Asgardeo account

Let's begin setting up your Asgardeo account.

## Create an organization

An organization in Asgardeo will be your own unique space and it will contain your users and application configurations. Let's sign up and create your first organization.

1. Go to the [Asgardeo webpage](https://wso2.com/asgardeo/) and click **Sign up for free**.

2. Enter your email address and click **Register**. You will receive an email with instructions on how to complete your account creation.

3. Click **Confirm** on the email and fill in your information to create your Asgardeo account.

    !!! note

        You can also use one of the social login methods to create your account.


!!! tip "Access the Asgardeo Console"

    As an organization owner, or an administrator, you can manage all organizations, applications and users that you create using the Asgardeo Console. You can access the console using the following link.

    ```curl

    https://console.asgardeo.io/

    ```

## Create a user

Users can log in to applications that you register in Asgardeo. Let's create a user by following the steps below.

1. On the Asgardeo Console, go to **User Management** > **Users**.
2. Click **Add User** > **Single User**.
3. Fill in the user's details.

    ![customer-account-create-ui]({{base_path}}/assets/img/get-started/create-user-account.png){: width="500" style="display: block; margin: 0; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

4. Select **Set a password for the user** and enter a temporary password for the user. The user will be able to change the password later.

6. Click **Next** and **Finish**.

You can now manage this user account from the Asgardeo Console.

!!! note

    Users can also manage their own accounts from the Asgardeo self-service portal. Learn more about [user self-service]({{base_path}}/guides/user-self-service/).

1. Use a test application to quickly try out Asgardeo. See [Try login with Asgardeo]({{base_path}}/get-started/try-it-application/).
2. Set up Asgardeo in your application or in a sample application. See [Start integrating Asgardeo into applications]({{base_path}}/get-started/start-integrating-apps/).
