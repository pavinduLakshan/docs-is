# Accessibility compliance

This makes content on {{ product_name }} more accessible to a broader range of people with disabilities and makes the product more usable in general. With this, the business user registration interfaces and sign-in interfaces offered by {{ product_name }} are now operable through a keyboard interface. Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information anymore.

Content is now robust and understandable, making it more user-friendly.

WSO2 provides a [Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT)]({{base_path}}/assets/vpat.pdf) document for {{ product_name }} with details of the product's compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1).
