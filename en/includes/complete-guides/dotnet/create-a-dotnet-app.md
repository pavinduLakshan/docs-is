Provided that you have already installed the .NET SDK, we will proceed with setting up the development environment. This guide will utilize `Visual Studio Code` as the text editor and the official `C# Dev Kit` extension from Microsoft to help streamline the creation of the .NET application, which is of the Blazor Web app type.

There are several other approaches of creating a .NET application. If you need to create a rich, interactive web application, Blazor is a great choice. For cloud-based solutions, Azure Functions or ASP.NET Core are the go-to choices. If you're building a native mobile app, Xamarin or MAUI would be ideal, and for desktop apps, WPF, WinForms, or MAUI would be suitable. For the purposes of this guide we will be creating a server side web app with Blazor since it is a .NET frontend web framework that supports both server-side rendering and client interactivity in a single programming model.

This in turn allows for the following benefits:

- Create rich interactive UIs using C#.
- Share server-side and client-side app logic written in .NET.
- Render the UI as HTML and CSS for wide browser support, including mobile browsers.
- Build hybrid desktop and mobile apps with .NET and Blazor.


## Creating a New Project in Visual Studio Code

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Bring up the command palette by pressing:
    - `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux)
    - `Cmd + Shift + P` (macOS)
3. In the command palette, type and select `.NET: New Projectâ€¦`.
4. From the drop-down menu, select `Blazor Web App`.
5. Choose a suitable directory location for your project.
6. Enter a project name.
7. Click `Create Project` to create the project in the selected directory.

## Creating a New Project via the Command Line

Alternatively, if you prefer creating the application via the command line, you can use the following commands:

```bash
dotnet new blazor -o asgardeo-dotnet
```

```bash
cd asgardeo-dotnet
```

# Running the Application

Once the application is created, you can compile and run it using Visual Studio Code or the terminal.

## Running from Visual Studio Code

1. Navigate to the `Run and Debug` tab in the Activity Bar on the left side of Visual Studio Code.
2. Click the `Run and Debug` button.
3. Once the launch configurations are loaded, select the default configuration, ensuring that the debugger is set to `C#`.
4. After completing the setup, the application will launch in your web browser.

## Running from the Terminal

If you prefer using the terminal, you can execute the following command in the project directory to run the application:

```bash
dotnet run
```

Based on the configurations in your `/Properties/launchSettings.json` file, you would observe an output similar to the following.

`
Now listening on: http://localhost:5001
`

!!! note "Note"

    The port number may vary based on the configurations in the `Properties/launchSettings.json` file. If this is the case, please make sure to update the {{product_name}} application accordingly that was created in the previous step. Otherwise, you can utilize the following configurations in the `Properties/launchSettings.json` file.

    ```json
    {
      "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/launchsettings.json",
      "profiles": {
        "https": {
          "commandName": "Project",
          "dotnetRunMessages": true,
          "launchBrowser": true,
          "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:5001;http://localhost:5000",
          "environmentVariables": {
            "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
![Run .NET app]({{base_path}}/assets/img/complete-guides/dotnet/image5.png){: width="800" style="display: block; margin: 0;"}

You should now see the default Blazor Web App template running in your browser as shown above. Next we will look into configuring the authentication properties.
