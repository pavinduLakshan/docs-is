.NET is a versatile and powerful framework designed for building modern applications, including web, desktop, and mobile solutions. It provides a rich set of libraries and tools that allow developers to create robust, scalable, and high-performance applications. With its support for multiple programming languages and cross-platform development through .NET Core and .NET 6.0 or later, .NET is a popular choice for developing secure and feature-rich applications.

Implementing authentication and authorization in your .NET application is crucial for managing user access, safeguarding sensitive information, and ensuring the security of your app. By integrating with {{product_name}}, you can leverage industry-standard protocols like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) to provide your users with a seamless and secure login experience. This integration enhances user experience, protects sensitive data, and ensures compliance with modern security standards and regulations.


## Learning Objectives

This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about securing .NET applications, including implementing user login in your .NET app, integrating it with an Identity Provider (IdP) like {{product_name}} to make the login process simple and secure, and general guidelines to protect your end users. It also covers how to make secure API calls to an OAuth2-protected API from your .NET application.

In this guide, you will:

- Register an application in {{product_name}}
- Set up a .NET application
- Implement login and logout functionality
- Retrieve and display logged-in user details
- Secure routes and APIs in your application
- Access protected APIs using access tokens
- Manage tokens in your .NET application
