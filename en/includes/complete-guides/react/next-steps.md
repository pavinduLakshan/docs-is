    As you are now familiar with the concepts discussed in the guide, you can use the Asgardeo React template to bootstrap your application by running the following command.  

    ```bash

    npx tmplr --dir my-vite-react-app asgardeo/asgardeo-vite-react-template

    ```
    The Asgardeo React template generates a ready-made React sample app with pre-configured login and logout capabilities, helping you kick-start your project in just 2 minutes. 

    All you need is a `client_id`, which you can obtain by registering a **Single Page Application** in {{product_name}}.
