Next.js is a popular React framework that enables developers to build fast, scalable web applications with **Server-Side Rendering(SSR)** and **Static Site Generation(SSG)**. It allows for more efficient routing, performance optimization, and simplified deployment. By using reusable components and the built-in API routes, Next.js simplify the process of creating dynamic, user-driven web apps.

Implementing user login in your Next.js app is essential for managing access, personalizing user experiences, and securing the application. It helps improve user interaction, protects user data, boosts engagement, and ensures compliance with industry regulations.
