## Token Management in the Application

In this application, tokens are managed using the `next-auth` library, which provides a robust and flexible authentication solution for Next.js applications.

### Authentication Flow

The application uses the `CredentialsProvider` from `next-auth/providers/credentials` to handle OAuth2 authentication with **{{product_name}}**. When a user attempts to sign in, the `authorize` function is called with the user's credentials, including:

- An **authorization code**
- A flag indicating whether **Google Authenticator** is used

The `authorize` function then calls the `fetchOAuth2Token` utility function to exchange the authorization code for an **access token** and **user details**. The access token and user details are returned and stored in the session, allowing the user to be authenticated across different pages of the application.

### Logout Process

Additionally, the `logoutFromAsgardeo` utility function is used to handle the logout process, ensuring that the user's session is properly terminated including cookies.

## Other Ways to Manage Tokens in Next.js

### Session-Based Authentication
This method involves creating a **session** for the user on the server upon successful authentication. The **session ID** is stored in a cookie on the client side, and the server uses this session ID to retrieve the user's session data on subsequent requests.

**Pros:**
- Secure and allows easy token revocation
- Suitable for applications that require server-side session management

**Cons:**
- Requires maintaining session state on the server

### Custom Token Management
You can implement **custom token management** by generating and verifying tokens using libraries like `jsonwebtoken`. This method provides **flexibility and control** over the authentication process.

**Pros:**
- Provides complete control over token generation and validation
- Scalable for stateless authentication

**Cons:**
- Requires careful handling to ensure security and prevent token leaks
