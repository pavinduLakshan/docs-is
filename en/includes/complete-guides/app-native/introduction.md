In modern web applications, seamless authentication is a critical factor in delivering a smooth user experience. Traditional authentication methods often require users to be redirected to an external browser, which can disrupt the flow of an application. App-native authentication solves this by enabling authentication within the application's environment, eliminating unnecessary redirects and ensuring users remain engaged within the app.

This guide will walk you through integrating app-native authentication with {{product_name}} in a Next.js application. Next.js, a powerful React framework, offers features such as Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Static Site Generation (SSG), and API routes, making it an ideal choice for building scalable, high-performance applications. By leveraging Next.js's capabilities and {{product_name}}'s authentication mechanisms, we can implement a secure, seamless login system that enhances user experience and ensures compliance with industry standards.

Whether you're looking to improve user engagement, protect sensitive data, or simplify authentication workflows, this guide will provide step-by-step instructions to help you integrate {{product_name}}'s app-native authentication into your Next.js application efficiently.

### Learning objectives

This guide will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of how to implement app-native authentication in a Next.js application using {{product_name}}. You will learn how to integrate authentication seamlessly within your application, ensuring a secure and smooth login experience without external browser redirections. Additionally, you will gain insights into securing API calls, managing authentication tokens, and protecting user data.

By the end of this guide, you will be able to:

- Register an application in {{product_name}} to enable authentication.
- Set up a Next.js application with authentication capabilities.
- Install and configure the {{product_name}} provider for Auth.js, enabling seamless authentication.
- Implement login and logout functionality to allow users to authenticate within the app.
- Retrieve and display user details after a successful login.
- Secure application routes to restrict access based on authentication status.
- Access a protected API from your Next.js app using OAuth2 tokens.
- Manage authentication tokens effectively within the application to maintain session security.

By following this step-by-step guide, you will be equipped to integrate {{product_name}} app-native authentication into your Next.js app, ensuring a secure and streamlined user experience.
