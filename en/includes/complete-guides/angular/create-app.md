For this guide, you will be creating a simple Angular app using Angular CLI, the official tool provided by Angular to simplify project scaffolding and development.

!!! note

    The Angular OAuth2 OIDC SDK supports only up to Angular CLI version 17. Therefore, we are creating this application using Angular CLI version 17. 


Open a terminal, change the directory to where you want to initialize the project, and run the following command to create your first Angular sample application


```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli@17

ng new wso2-angular
```

Running this command will create a folder with a ready-made Angular application.

Once the application is created, install the necessary dependencies using the following command:


```bash

cd wso2-angular

npm install
```

Then run the sample in the development mode. This allows you to see real-time updates and debug the app as you make changes.

```bash
ng serve
```

By default, the development server will run on the port 4200. You can navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200){:target="_blank"}  in your browser, and you should see the sample application working as expected.

![Navigate to localhost]({{base_path}}/assets/img/complete-guides/angular/image6.png){: width="600" style="display: block; margin: 0;"}

At this point, you have a simple yet fully functional Angular app. In the next step, letâ€™s try to integrate an authentication SDK with the app.
