Angular is a widely-used front-end framework built on TypeScript, designed for creating robust single-page applications (SPAs). It offers a structured and modular approach to building dynamic UIs, making it easier for developers to manage complex applications by breaking them down into reusable components. Angular’s two-way data binding and dependency injection, coupled with its component-based architecture, streamline UI updates without requiring the entire page to reload. This makes Angular a popular choice for developing SPAs.
Implementing login in your Angular app is essential for managing user access, personalizing user experiences, and ensuring app security. It improves user experience, secures user data, increases engagement, and helps meet regulatory compliance.

## Learning objectives 

This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about securing Angular apps, including implementing user login in your Angular app, integrating it with an Identity Provider (IdP) to make the login process simple and secure, and general guidelines to protect your end users. It also covers how to make secure API calls to an OAuth2-protected API within your Angular app.

In this guide, you will:

* Register an application in {{product_name}}
* Create a Angular app
* Install Authentication SDK into the app
* Add login and logout  to your app
* Display logged in user detail
* Securing routes within the app
* Accessing protected API from your Angular app
* Managing tokens in your Angular app
