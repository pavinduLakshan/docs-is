During the development phase, applications often include debug logs in the browser console, use hardcoded values, or retain test configurations. These practices, while useful for debugging, can expose sensitive information or introduce security vulnerabilities if left in the production environment.


The SDKs are designed to be production-ready out of the box, requiring no additional changes. However, it's essential to review your application's design and code to ensure it's production-ready. This includes removing any debug logs from the browser console, eliminating hardcoded values, securing configurations, and conducting a thorough security audit to mitigate potential risks

Ensuring the ongoing security and efficiency of your application requires regular maintenance of the SDK and its components. Using outdated or vulnerable components can expose your application to security risks and hinder performance.


- **Vulnerable and Outdated Components:** Regularly check for SDK updates and other dependencies. Keeping components up to date minimizes security vulnerabilities. Tools like dependency checkers can help automate this process, ensuring that youâ€™re always using the latest, most secure versions.

- **Minimization:** Remove any unused dependencies and code to reduce the attack surface of your application. This practice not only improves security but also enhances performance.

- **Continuous Review:** Incorporate a continuous review process into your CI/CD pipeline. This includes security testing, code quality checks, and dependency scanning to catch potential issues early and ensure that your application remains secure and efficient over time.

- **dditional Best Practices:** Beyond maintaining the SDK, ensure your application follows industry best practices. This includes implementing secure coding practices, using strong encryption methods, regularly conducting security audits, and ensuring that your CI/CD pipeline is secure and resilient against threats.

By continuously maintaining the SDK and adhering to these best practices, you can ensure that your application remains secure, performant, and ready for production.
