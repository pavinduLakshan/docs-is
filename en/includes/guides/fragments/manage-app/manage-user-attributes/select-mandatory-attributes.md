If your application needs certain attributes for the successful function of the application, you can make them mandatory attributes. Users logging into the application should then have the mandatory attributes either pre-filled in their profiles or provide the required information when prompted during the login flow.

To make an attribute mandatory:

1. On the {{product_name}} console, go to **Applications**.

2. Select the application and go to its **User attributes** tab.

3. Expand the relevant scope and out of the selected attributes for the application, select the mandatory attributes by selecting the **Mandatory** checkbox next to them.
