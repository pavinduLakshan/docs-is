# Identity Verification

Identity verification (IDV) is a crucial component of managing user access and verifying identities in systems and platforms. It enables organizations to confirm the identity of users through various authentication methods, such as by checking legal documents such as passports, national identification cards, and driver's licenses.

IDV is a critical aspect of security and risk management, as it helps to prevent identity fraud and ensures that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive systems and data. By having IDV, organizations can protect themselves from potential threats and enhance the overall security of their systems.

## Manage Identity Verification

{{ product_name }} facilitates identity verification by establishing a connection with a third-party identity verification provider (IDVP). Within {{ product_name }}, the users' identity verification status is efficiently managed, along with the associated metadata received from the IDVP.

- You may onboard and manage an IDVP from the {{product_name}} Console. Learn more in [configure an IDVP]({{base_path}}/guides/identity-verification/configure-identity-verification-provider/).

- You may also use the [Identity Verification Provider management API]({{base_path}}/apis/identity-verification-providers/) to add, update and delete IDVPs.
