# Manage active sessions

A session corresponds to the time a user spends on an application from a single user agent (e.g., browser) instance. Generally, session duration is the time between when a user logs in and ends when the user logs out.

{{ product_name }} maintains user sessions based on session cookies. Active sessions in {{ product_name }} are terminated in the following instances:

- User closes the browser
- User tries to terminate the sessions via the {{ product_name }} Console and My Account
- User logs out of an application
- User resets the password

Active sessions can be terminated explicitly by using the session management APIs as well.

An administrator or an owner can view and terminate the active session(s) of users via the {{ product_name }} Console.

To view all active sessions of a user:

1. On the {{ product_name }} Console, go to **User Management** > **Users**.
