Following are the properties that can be configured in JDBC user store manager.

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>ReadGroups</td>
<td>read_groups</td>
<td>ReadGroups</td>
<td>When ReadGroups is set to <code>false</code>, it indicates whether groups should be read from the user store. If this is disabled, none of the groups in the user store can be read, and the following group configurations are NOT mandatory: GroupSearchBase, GroupNameListFilter, or GroupNameAttribute.<br />
<br />
<p>Default : true <br/>
Possible values:<br/>
true: Reads groups from user store<br />
false: Does not read groups from user store</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>WriteGroups</td>
<td>write_groups</td>
<td>WriteGroups</td>
<td>Indicates whether groups should be written to the user store<br />
<br />
<p>Default : true <br/>
Possible values:<br />
true : Writes groups to user store<br />
false : Does not write groups to the user store, so only internal roles can be created. The value of the ReadGroups property determines whether the existing user store groups can be read or not.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>PasswordHashMethod</td>
<td>password_hash_method</td>
<td>Password Hashing Algorithm</td>
<td><p>Specifies the Password Hashing Algorithm used to hash the password before storing it in the user store<br />
Possible values:<br />
SHA - Uses SHA digest method including SHA-1 and SHA-256<br />
MD5 - Uses MD 5 digest method<br />
PLAIN_TEXT - Plain text passwords</p>
<p>If you just enter the value `SHA`, it will be considered as `SHA-1`. It is always better to configure an algorithm with a higher bit value so that the digest bit size would be increased.
<br />
The default value for JDBC user stores is SHA-256.

<td>This property is used to define a character to separate multiple attributes. This ensures that it will not appear as part of a claim value. Normally “,” is used to separate multiple attributes, but you can define ",,," or "..." or a similar character sequence.<br />

<td>This controls the number of users listed in the user store of WSO2 Identity Server. This is useful when you have a large number of users and do not want to list them all. Setting this property to 0 displays all users. (Default: 100)<br />
<br />
In some user stores, there are policies to limit the number of records that can be returned from a query. By setting the value to 0, it will list the maximum results returned by the user store. If you need to increase this number, you need to set it in the user store level.<br />
Eg: Active directory has the MaxPageSize property with the default value of 100.</td>
