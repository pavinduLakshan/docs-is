# Configure a Read-write Active Directory User store

!!! tip    
    For Read-only Active Directory user store manager configuration, use [read-only LDAP user store manager configuration properties]({{base_path}}/guides/users/user-stores/primary-user-store/configure-a-read-only-ldap-user-store/).

Refer [Properties for a read-write Active Directory user store]({{base_path}}/guides/users/user-stores/user-store-properties/properties-read-write-active-directory-user-store/) to find the properties which are supported for read-write Active Directory user stores. Below is a sample with minimum configurations and properties to change the primary user store to a read-write Active Directory user store.

```toml
[user_store]
type = "active_directory_unique_id"
base_dn = "dc=wso2,dc=org"
connection_url = "ldaps://10.100.1.102:639"
connection_name = "cn=admin,ou=system"
connection_password = "admin"
```

!!! note
    It is recommended to use the `whenCreated` and `whenChanged` operational attributes for
    `created` and `modified` attributes. Therefore, add the following to the `deployment.toml` file.
    ``` toml
    [user_store]
    timestamp_attributes = "whenCreated,whenChanged"
    immutable_attributes = "objectGuid,whenCreated,whenChanged"
    ```
    
    !!! warning
        If there are more immutable attributes, you need to add them to the `immutable_attributes` property.

In addition to the above, please make sure that you import the Active Directory user store public certificate to the 
WSO2 Identity Serverâ€™s client trust store. To perform this, you need to navigate to the 
`<IS_HOME>repository/resources/security` directory and execute the following command to import the certificate to 
client-truststore of WSO2 Identity Server.

```
keytool -import -alias certalias -file <certificate>.pem -keystore client-truststore.{{default_keystore_ext}} -storetype {{default_keystore_type}} -storepass wso2carbon
```

!!! note
    `wso2carbon` is the keystore password of the default client-truststore.{{default_keystore_ext}} file of WSO2 Identity Server.

Furthermore, please make sure to follow the steps mentioned in [Configure Active Directory User stores for SCIM 2.0 based Inbound Provisioning]({{base_path}}/guides/users/user-stores/configure-active-directory-user-stores-for-scim2) 
since SCIM is enabled by default from the WSO2 Identity Server 5.10.0 onwards.


### Initial configuration for new servers

If you are configuring a server that has not been started yet, you need to update the claim mappings in
`<carbon_home>/repository/conf/claim-config.xml`.

!!! note
    Following are some of the mandatory claims that you need to map with the user store attributes.

      - `http://wso2.org/claims/username`
      - `http://wso2.org/claims/userid`
      - `http://wso2.org/claims/created`
      - `http://wso2.org/claims/modified`
      {% if not is_version == "7.0.0" %}
      - `http://wso2.org/claims/emailAddresses`
      - `http://wso2.org/claims/verifiedAddresses`
      - `http://wso2.org/claims/mobileNumbers`
      - `http://wso2.org/claims/verifiedMobileNumbers`
      {% endif %}

    For `created` and `modified` claims, it is recommended to use the `whenCreated` and `whenChanged` 
    operational attributes.

    For `username` and `userid` claims, the `Username Attribute` and `User ID Attribute` properties configured in the User Store configuration should be used to ensure proper user authentication.

### Updating configuration for existing servers

!!! warning
    Changing the primary user store of a production server can have a significant impact on the users and the applications that are using the system. Therefore, it is recommended to have a scheduled maintenance window to perform this task.

Before you change `deployment.toml` with above configurations, you need to change the attributes mappings for the
`PRIMARY` user store by navigating to the **User Attributes & Stores** > **Attributes** section of the console. After
updating the mappings, shutdown the server, update the `deployment.toml` file and restart the server to apply the
configurations.

!!! note
    Following are some of the mandatory claims that you need to map with the user store attributes.

      - `http://wso2.org/claims/username`
      - `http://wso2.org/claims/userid`
      - `http://wso2.org/claims/created`
      - `http://wso2.org/claims/modified`
      {% if not is_version == "7.0.0" %}
      - `http://wso2.org/claims/emailAddresses`
      - `http://wso2.org/claims/verifiedAddresses`
      - `http://wso2.org/claims/mobileNumbers`
      - `http://wso2.org/claims/verifiedMobileNumbers`
      {% endif %}
    
    Refer to the [Update Attributes]({{base_path}}/guides/users/attributes/manage-attributes/#update-attributes) 
    to learn more on updating attribute mappings.  For `created` and `modified` claims, it is recommended to use the 
    `whenCreated` and `whenChanged` operational attributes.

    For `username` and `userid` claims, the `Username Attribute` and `User ID Attribute` properties configured in the User Store configuration should be used to ensure proper user authentication.

    {% if not is_version == "7.0.0" %}
    Ensure that multiple email addresses and mobile numbers attributes are properly configured by following the instructions in the [Assign multiple email addresses and mobile numbers to a user]({{base_path}}/guides/users/attributes/manage-attributes/#assign-multiple-email-addresses-and-mobile-numbers-to-a-user) section.
    {% endif %}

    !!! Warning
        If you have more than one tenant, you need to change the claim mappings for each tenant before adding the 
        new configurations to the `deployment.toml` file.
        
        If are planning to create new tenants in the future, you need to update the claim mappings in 
        `<carbon_home>/repository/conf/claim-config.xml`. 


## Configure tenant manager

Configure the tenant manager to user CommonHybridLDAPTenantManager.  Make sure to configure `RootPartition` property
as it determines the root of the LDAP tree.

``` toml
[tenant_manager.ldap]
enabled=true
class="org.wso2.carbon.user.core.tenant.CommonHybridLDAPTenantManager"
[tenant_manager.ldap.properties]
RootPartition="dc=example,dc=org"
```
