# Configure high availability for a remote user store

It is recommended to maintain high availability for your remote user store in {{ product_name }} as it includes user information that must be available at all times.

To maintain high availability for the remote user store, you need to connect a second user store agent.

## Prerequisites

[Configure and connect a remote user store]({{base_path}}/guides/users/user-stores/configure-a-user-store/) in {{ product_name }}.

## Connect a second user store agent

To connect a second user store agent:

1. On the {{ product_name }} Console, go to **User Attributes & Stores** > **User Stores**.
2. Select your user store from the **User stores** list.
3. In the **General** tab, a second user store agent is listed under **User Store Agent Connection(s)**.
4. Click **Generate token** on the second user store agent.

    !!! note
        An installation token can only be used to connect to one user store agent. You cannot use the same installation token to run a second agent.

5. Run a second user store agent by navigating to its root directory and by using one of the following commands based on your operating system:

    === "Linux/OSx"
        ``` json 
        sh wso2agent.sh
        ```

    === "Windows"
        ``` json 
        wso2agent.bat
        ```

    Enter the second installation token generated in the previous step when prompted.
