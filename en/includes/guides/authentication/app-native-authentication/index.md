# App-native authentication

App-native authentication is an API-based mechanism that enables developers to integrate authentication within an application's environment.

This means that users logging into the application do not have to be redirected to an external web browser for login resulting in a seamless user experience. As a business, you can leverage app-native authentication to retain users within the application's environment at all times.
