# Organizations

If you are a Business-to-Business (B2B) service provider, you may use {{product_name}}'s organizations to represent your partners/suppliers. You may then share your applications with organizations that should have access to them. Moreover, you may delegate administration of organizations to admins within the organizations so that they can start managing access to the shared applications.

- Partners/Suppliers of your business must be set up as organizations in your organization.
